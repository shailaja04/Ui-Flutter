# Flutter UI Projects

This repository contains a collection of Flutter UI projects and exercises to help understand Flutter and Dart basics, explore widgets, implement responsive designs, and learn navigation and state management.

## Table of Contents

1. [Getting Started](#getting-started)  
2. [Dart Basics](#dart-basics)  
3. [Flutter Widgets](#flutter-widgets)  
4. [Layouts](#layouts)  
5. [Responsive UI](#responsive-ui)  
6. [Navigation](#navigation)  
7. [State Management](#state-management)  

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- Install [Dart SDK](https://dart.dev/get-dart)
- A code editor (VS Code / Android Studio)

### Installation
Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/shailaja04/Ui-Flutter.git
cd Ui-Flutter
````

## Dart Basics

* Write simple Dart programs to understand the syntax, variables, loops, functions, and classes.
* Example:

```dart
void main() {
  print("Hello, Flutter!");
}
```

## Flutter Widgets

* Explore basic Flutter widgets like:

  * `Text`
  * `Image`
  * `Container`
  * `Button`
* Example:

```dart
Container(
  padding: EdgeInsets.all(20),
  color: Colors.blue,
  child: Text("Hello World", style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white)),
)
```

## Layouts

* Implement different layout structures using:

  * `Row`
  * `Column`
  * `Stack`
* Example:

```dart
Column(
  children: [
    Text("Flutter"),
    Row(
      children: [Icon(Icons.star), Icon(Icons.star_border)],
    ),
  ],
)
```

## Responsive UI

* Design UI that adapts to different screen sizes.
* Use MediaQuery and breakpoints for responsiveness:

```dart
var screenWidth = MediaQuery.of(context).size.width;
if(screenWidth > 600) {
  // Layout for tablets
} else {
  // Layout for phones
}
```

## Navigation

* Set up navigation between screens using `Navigator`.
* Implement navigation with named routes:

```dart
Navigator.pushNamed(context, '/secondScreen');
```

## State Management

* Learn about **StatelessWidget** and **StatefulWidget**.
* Manage state using:

  * `setState()`
  * `Provider` (for more advanced state management)

```dart
setState(() {
  counter++;
});
```
